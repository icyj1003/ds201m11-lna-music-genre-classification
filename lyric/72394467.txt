the other night dear as i lay sleeping i dreamed i held you in my arms when i awoke dear i was mistaken so i hung my head and i cried you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray you ll never know dear how much i love you please don t take my sunshine away so let the sunshine in face it with a grin smilers never loose and frowners never win so let the sunshine in face it with a grin open up your heart and let the sunshine in my mommy told me something that little girls should know it s all about the devil and i ve learned to hate him so i know he ll be unhappy cause i ll never wear a frown maybe if we keep on smiling he ll get tired of hangin round
