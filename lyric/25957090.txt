last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i ll give it to someone special 1 once bitten and twice shy i keep my distance but you still catch my eye tell me baby do you recognize me well it s been a year it doesn t surprise me happy christmas i wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying i love you i meant it now i know what a fool i ve been but if you kissed me now i know you d fool me again 2 a crowded room friends with tired eyes i m hiding from you and your soul of ice oh my i thought you were someone to rely on me i guess i was a shoulder to cry on a friend to discover with a fire in her heart a girl under cover but you tore me apart you tore me apart now i ve found a real love you ll never fool me again maybe next year i ll give it to someone i ll give it to someone special
