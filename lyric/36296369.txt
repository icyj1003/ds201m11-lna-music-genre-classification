night tonight is so cold freezing to my lips cause you promised you will come back i wonder where you are i ve been waiting for you hurt my heart s broken down trying to forget because your love is not for me fading our memories we had but i don t want miss you every night miss you every day maybe in a dream i ll see you back give me a hug to warm my heart to wake my soul open my eyes if tomorrow comes and you won t come back you re still always inside my mind i just wanna see your happy smile though you re not coming back to me
