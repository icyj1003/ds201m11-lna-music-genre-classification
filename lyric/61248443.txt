1 that day that month that year i can t forget before i felt regret that day that month that year i can t forget the first day we ever met still beautiful in my mind that day felt sublime when my eyes were waiting for a lovely view you called my name softly the man i was looking for for a long time long time you know 2 which day which month which year oh i forgot when you and i fell off the top which day which month which year oh i forgot when you and i were torn a part just vague in my mind a day can t define when i couldn t even bare the thought of you was screaming your name desperately but you just kept walking away from me why can t you hear why can t you hear my voice anymore
