1 each day i live i want to be a day to give the best of me i m only one but not alone my finest day is yet unknown i broke my heart fought every gain to taste the sweet i face the pain i rise and fall yet through it all this much remains i want give me one moment in time when i m more than i thought i could be when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away and the answers are all up to me give me one moment in time when i m racing with destiny then in that one moment of time i will feel i will feel eternity 2 i ve lived to be the very best i want it all no time for less i ve laid the plans now lay the chance here in my hands you re a winner for a lifetime if you seize that one moment in time make it shine
