1 lately i feel kinda crazy and hazy so i go for a walk alone into the darkness talking to myself lately i feel burning burning so i m seeking for the rain and all the memories of you and me now it s the only thing i really need and all the memories of you and me now it s the only thing i really need cause i still feel you behind me following my dreams with me why did i let you be why did i leave and you cry and i lie and i try to justify why why i still feel you behind me following my dreams with me why did i let you be why did i leave and you cry and i lie and i try to justify why why 2 breaking through easy gold and rocking the world i had it all i wanted it all i wasn t kidding everything for a dream just for myself now it seem like my head doesn t have a neck tone of guilt on my back broke inside lost run away dog it s all wrong and now i see it s not all about me at last i found the truth that i ve got no dreams without you at last i found the truth that i ve got no dreams without you
