don t forget to tell all the story every little thing you did out there don t forget the time you took my tears every single day was filled with pain don t be sad dont be scared don t be the same don t be ashamed so i so i so i don t let the past take back my heart so i so i so i lost my mind i don t know don t forget to say you re so sorry never need to whisper so faintly let the sunshine down on me again let it warm up my heart to make a new start don t be sad dont be scared don t be the same don t be ashamed
